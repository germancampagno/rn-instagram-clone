## Testing ðŸš€
Since this project has been developed with Expo Go for ease of use, in order to test it, run the following commands:

- npm install
- npx expo start
  
After running `npx expo start`, clear instructions will appear in the terminal, for example: press w to run it on a web browser / download the Expo Go application on a physical device in the same Wi-Fi network / more options like using an iOS or Android emulator

## Libraries used ðŸ“š

- [Axios](https://axios-http.com/) for networking
- [MomentJS](https://momentjs.com/) for Date formatting

## Nice to have ðŸ‘€
- ESLint
- Localizable Strings
- Unit tests
- UI Tests
- Dark Mode compatibility
