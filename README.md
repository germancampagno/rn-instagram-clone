# rn-instagram-clone
Simple Instagram feed clone in React Native



Since this project has been developed with Expo Go for ease of use, in order to test it, run the following commands:

- npm install
- npx expo start
  
After running `npx expo start`, clear instructions will appear in the terminal, for example: press w to run it on a web browser / download the Expo Go application on a physical device in the same Wi-Fi network / more options like using an iOS or Android emulator



Nice to have:
- ESLint
- Localizable Strings
